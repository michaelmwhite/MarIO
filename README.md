# MarIO
My implementation of a NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies Network that plays Super Mario (USA) on the Bizhawk Emulator. 

This project was inspired by [SethBling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44), and the primary resource for NEAT networks is Stanley and Miikkulainen's [paper](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf).
